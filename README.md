This is me setting stuff into the README to walk someone through getting set up with the project and what the process might look like as a whole.

The first step is to clone the project, through the git clone that we saw.  I will be committing this README to the Repository on Github, where you saw nothing was contained in the README before the commit I am about to make.

Of course this README will change in the future, but for now I just wanted to use it as an example.  By the way this is the VIM text editor in the terminal.. I could alternatively use any other text editor, which I'll demonstrate in a second.

At which point now I could modify here and save and the changes will take effect in the working directory of the repository for now.
